      <h2 style="color:rgb(129, 198, 141); font-size: 50px; font-family:'Libre Bodoni', serif; text-align: center; margin-top: 110px; border: solid; border-color:rgb(129, 198, 141); border-width: 1px; border-style: double; margin-left: 500px; margin-right: 500px;">Summary</h2>
      <p style="color: rgb(91, 91, 94); margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 300px; margin-top: 15px; font-size: 17px;">In the beginning, Bob created many, many failed worlds. 
        It was World 53,116 that Bob named Thera, and Bob saw great potential within it. 
        With 53,115 failed world's worth of knowledge, Bob decorated Thera in vegetation and life, creating a perfect place for mortals to thrive. 
        Bob was cautious though. 
        Bob had learnt from his last mistakes and decided to create 3 divine beings to watch over and protect Thera. 
        The first was Damion, who offered the mortals power and great strength. 
        The second was Phir, who bestowed healing and wealth upon Thera. 
        The third was Uzair, who taught morals and humanity, looking into the future of mankind and forming prophecies as a guide for the mortals. 
        For 999 years, the world grew and man became corrupt with the great things they were given. 
        Bob saw this, but yet, he could not destroy, only create. 
        So Bob went down to Thera and chose a mortal, naming him Covah and blessing him with the threefold power of the ancients. Covah became the ancient of balance and punishment, creating karma and disease to teach the mortals humility and kindness. 
        With those 4 ancients, Thera prospered until Covah's Fall, which resulted in the Thorne Family Massacre of 1857. 
        That was when Thera began to fall apart, and where our story begins.</p>

      <h5 style="color:rgb(40, 156, 40); font-family:'Libre Bodoni', serif; font-size: 30px; text-align: center; padding-top: 20px;">Adryan Thorne</h5>
      <p style="color:rgb(91, 91, 94); margin-left: 420px; margin-right: 420px;">Adryan Thorne is the main protagonist of Villain Chronicles who acts as one of the many villains who join together in hopes of stopping Covah's reign before it begins. Adryan lives with his wife Zarah in Initiare City, trying to avoid his role in Uzair's Prophecy. Eventually, he accepts his role and assists the others in finding Bob's Last Remnant and the 4 Ancient Relics.</p>
      <h5 style="color:rgb(40, 156, 40); font-family:'Libre Bodoni', serif; font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">Covah</h5>
      <p style="color:rgb(91, 91, 94); margin-left: 420px; margin-right: 420px;">Covah lived as a mortal on Thera until Bob, creator of their world granted Covah the abilities of an Ancient. From then on, Covah was tasked with controlling human population and creating karma to use against prideful mortals. In time, Covah felt that the other Ancients were unworthy of their power and that Bob himself had left them. That was when Covah took it upon himself to rule Thera as his own, no matter how many Ancients stood in his path.</p>
